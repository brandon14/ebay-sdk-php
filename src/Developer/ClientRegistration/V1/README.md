<span class=\"tablenote\"><b>Note:</b> The Client Registration API is not intended for use by developers who have previously registered for a Developer Account on the eBay platform.</span><br/>The Client Registration API provides Dynamic Client Registration for regulated Third Party Providers (TPPs) who are, or will be, engaged in financial transactions on behalf of individuals domiciled in the EU/UK. This is required by the EU's Second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) which requires all regulated Account Servicing Payment Service Providers (ASPSPs) to provide secure APIs to access account and payment services on behalf of account holders.<br/><br/>A successful registration response returns a <b>HTTP 201 Created</b> status code with a JSON payload [RFC7519] that includes registration information.
