  title: Buy Feed API
  description: The Feed API provides the ability to download TSV_GZIP feed files containing eBay items and an hourly snapshot file for a specific category, date, and marketplace.<br /><br />In addition to the API, there is an open-source Feed SDK written in Java that downloads, combines files into a single file when needed, and unzips the entire feed file. It also lets you specify field filters to curate the items in the file.
