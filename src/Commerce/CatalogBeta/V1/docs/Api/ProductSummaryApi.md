## `search()`

```php
search($aspect_filter, $category_ids, $fieldgroups, $gtin, $limit, $mpn, $offset, $q): \TNT\Ebay\Commerce\CatalogBeta\V1\Model\ProductSearchResponse
```



This call searches for and retrieves summaries of one or more products in the eBay catalog that match the search criteria provided by a seller. The seller can use the summaries to select the product in the eBay catalog that corresponds to the item that the seller wants to offer for sale. When a corresponding product is found and adopted by the seller, eBay will use the product information to populate the item listing. The criteria supported by search include keywords, product categories, and category aspects. To see the full details of a selected product, use the getProduct call. In addition to product summaries, this call can also be used to identify refinements, which help you to better pinpoint the product you're looking for. A refinement consists of one or more aspect values and a count of the number of times that each value has been used in previous eBay listings. An aspect is a property (e.g. color or size) of an eBay category, used by sellers to provide details about the items they're listing. The refinement container is returned when you include the fieldGroups query parameter in the request with a value of ASPECT_REFINEMENTS or FULL. Example A seller wants to find a product that is &quot;gray&quot; in color, but doesn't know what term the manufacturer uses for that color. It might be Silver, Brushed Nickel, Pewter, or even Grey. The returned refinement container identifies all aspects that have been used in past listings for products that match your search criteria, along with all of the values those aspects have taken, and the number of times each value was used. You can use this data to present the seller with a histogram of the values of each aspect. The seller can see which color values have been used in the past, and how frequently they have been used, and selects the most likely value or values for their product. You issue the search call again with those values in the aspect_filter parameter to narrow down the collection of products returned by the call. Although all query parameters are optional, this call must include at least the q parameter, or the category_ids, gtin, or mpn parameter with a valid value. If you provide more than one of these parameters, they will be combined with a logical AND to further refine the returned collection of matching products. Note: This call requires that certain special characters in the query parameters be percent-encoded: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(space) = %20 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, = %2C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;: = %3A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[ = %5B &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] = %5D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{ = %7B &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| = %7C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} = %7D This requirement applies to all query parameter values. However, for readability, call examples and samples in this documentation will not use the encoding. This call returns product summaries rather than the full details of the products. To retrieve the full details of a product, use the getProduct call with an ePID.

### Example

```php
<?php
require_once(__DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php');


// Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: api_auth
$config = TNT\Ebay\Commerce\CatalogBeta\V1\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()->setAccessToken('YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN');


$apiInstance = new TNT\Ebay\Commerce\CatalogBeta\V1\Api\ProductSummaryApi(
    // If you want use custom http client, pass your client which implements `GuzzleHttp\ClientInterface`.
    // This is optional, `GuzzleHttp\Client` will be used as default.
    new GuzzleHttp\Client(),
    $config
);
$aspect_filter = 'aspect_filter_example'; // string | An eBay category and one or more aspects of that category, with the values that can be used to narrow down the collection of products returned by this call. Aspects are product attributes that can represent different types of information for different products. Every product has aspects, but different products have different sets of aspects. You can determine appropriate values for the aspects by first submitting this call without this parameter. It will return either the productSummaries.aspects container, the refinement.aspectDistributions container, or both, depending on the value of the fieldgroups parameter in the request. The productSummaries.aspects container provides the category aspects and their values that are associated with each returned product. The refinement.aspectDistributions container provides information about the distribution of values of the set of category aspects associated with the specified categories. In both cases sellers can select from among the returned aspects to use with this parameter. Note: You can also use the Taxonomy API's getItemAspectsForCategory call to retrieve detailed information about aspects and their values that are appropriate for your selected category. The syntax for the aspect_filter parameter is as follows (on several lines for readability; categoryId is required): aspect_filter=categoryId:category_id, aspect1:{valueA|valueB|...}, aspect2:{valueC|valueD|...},... A matching product must be within the specified category, and it must have least one of the values identified for every specified aspect. Note: Aspect names and values are case sensitive. Here is an example of an aspect_filter parameter in which 9355 is the category ID, Color is an aspect of that category, and Black and White are possible values of that aspect (on several lines for readability): GET https://api.ebay.com/commerce/catalog/v1_beta/product_summary/search? aspect_filter=categoryId:9355,Color:{White|Black} Here is the aspect_filter with required URL encoding and a second aspect (on several lines for readability): GET https://api.ebay.com/commerce/catalog/v1_beta/product_summary/search? aspect_filter=categoryId:9355,Color:%7BWhite%7CBlack%7D, Storage%20Capacity:%128GB%7C256GB%7D Note: You cannot use the aspect_filter parameter in the same call with either the gtin parameter or the mpn parameter. For implementation help, refer to eBay API documentation at https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/commerce/catalog/types/catal:AspectFilter
$category_ids = 'category_ids_example'; // string | Important: Currently, only the first category_id value is accepted. One or more comma-separated category identifiers for narrowing down the collection of products returned by this call. Note: This parameter requires a valid category ID value. You can use the Taxonomy API's getCategorySuggestions call to retrieve appropriate category IDs for your product based on keywords. The syntax for this parameter is as follows: category_ids=category_id1,category_id2,... Here is an example of a call with the category_ids parameter: GET https://api.ebay.com/commerce/catalog/v1_beta/product_summary/search? category_ids=178893 Note: Although all query parameters are optional, this call must include at least the q parameter, or the category_ids, gtin, or mpn parameter with a valid value. If you provide only the category_ids parameter, you cannot specify a top-level (L1) category.
$fieldgroups = 'fieldgroups_example'; // string | The type of information to return in the response. Important: This parameter may not produce valid results if you also provide more than one value for the category_ids parameter. It is recommended that you avoid using this combination. Valid Values: ASPECT_REFINEMENTS &mdash; This returns the refinement container, which includes the category aspect and aspect value distributions that apply to the returned products. For example, if you searched for Ford Mustang, some of the category aspects might be Model Year, Exterior Color, Vehicle Mileage, and so on. Note: Aspects are category specific. FULL &mdash; This returns all the refinement containers and all the matching products. This value overrides the other values, which will be ignored. MATCHING_PRODUCTS &mdash; This returns summaries for all products that match the values you provide for the q and category_ids parameters. This does not affect your use of the ASPECT_REFINEMENTS value, which you can use in the same call. Code so that your app gracefully handles any future changes to this list. Default: MATCHING_PRODUCTS
$gtin = 'gtin_example'; // string | A string consisting of one or more comma-separated Global Trade Item Numbers (GTINs) that identify products to search for. Currently the GTIN values can include EAN, ISBN, and UPC identifier types. Note: Although all query parameters are optional, this call must include at least the q parameter, or the category_ids, gtin, or mpn parameter with a valid value. You cannot use the gtin parameter in the same call with either the q parameter or the aspect_filter parameter.
$limit = 'limit_example'; // string | The number of product summaries to return. This is the result set, a subset of the full collection of products that match the search or filter criteria of this call. Maximum: 200 Default: 50
$mpn = 'mpn_example'; // string | A string consisting of one or more comma-separated Manufacturer Part Numbers (MPNs) that identify products to search for. This call will return all products that have one of the specified MPNs. MPNs are defined by manufacturers for their own products, and are therefore certain to be unique only within a given brand. However, many MPNs do turn out to be globally unique. Note: Although all query parameters are optional, this call must include at least the q parameter, or the category_ids, gtin, or mpn parameter with a valid value. You cannot use the mpn parameter in the same call with either the q parameter or the aspect_filter parameter.
$offset = 'offset_example'; // string | This parameter is reserved for internal or future use.
$q = 'q_example'; // string | A string consisting of one or more keywords to use to search for products in the eBay catalog. Note: This call searches the following product record fields: title, description, brand, and aspects.localizedName, which do not include product IDs. Wildcard characters (e.g. *) are not allowed. The keywords are handled as follows: If the keywords are separated by a comma (e.g. iPhone,256GB), the query returns products that have iPhone AND 256GB. If the keywords are separated by a space (e.g. &quot;iPhone&nbsp;ipad&quot; or &quot;iPhone,&nbsp;ipad&quot;), the query ignores any commas and returns products that have iPhone OR iPad. Note: Although all query parameters are optional, this call must include at least the q parameter, or the category_ids, gtin, or mpn parameter with a valid value. You cannot use the q parameter in the same call with either the gtin parameter or the mpn parameter.

try {
    $result = $apiInstance->search($aspect_filter, $category_ids, $fieldgroups, $gtin, $limit, $mpn, $offset, $q);
    print_r($result);
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo 'Exception when calling ProductSummaryApi->search: ', $e->getMessage(), PHP_EOL;
}
