## Purpose

A single package containing a PHP SDK to access all of Ebay's OpenAPI spec endpoints found
[here](https://developer.ebay.com/docs). It only covers the RESTful APIs that have OpenAPI specifications available.

To view the OpenAPI files these packages were generated from, please browse the `api-specs` directory.

## Installation

You can install the entire bundle of Ebay libraries via:

```bash
composer require brandon14/ebay-sdk-php
```

_NOTE: This is not implemented yet, and will be available in an upcoming release once we get the subtree splitting
set up._

If you wish to install individual API libraries, you can via the following (this would for example install the
`Buy/Browser/V1` library):

```bash
composer require brandon14/ebay-buy-browse-v1

# More generic:
# composer require brandon14/ebay-<general-api>-<api>-<version>
```

## Standards

We strive to meet the [PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/) coding style for PHP projects, and enforce our
coding standard via the [php-cs-fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer) linting tool. Our ruleset can be
found in the `.php-cs-fixer.dist.php` file.

## Coverage

The latest code coverage information can be found via [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/brandon14/ebay-sdk-php). We
strive to maintain 100% coverage across the entire Ebay API, so if you are
[contributing](https://github.com/brandon14/ebay-sdk-php#contributing), please make sure to include tests for new
code added.

## Documentation
