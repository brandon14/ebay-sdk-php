To place a bid, you pass in the item ID of the auction as a URI parameter and the buyer''s maximum bid amount (maxAmount ) in the payload. By placing a proxy bid, the buyer is agreeing to purchase the item if they win the auction. After this bid is placed, if someone else outbids the buyer a bid, eBay automatically bids again for the buyer up to the amount of their maximum bid. When the bid exceeds the buyer''s maximum bid, eBay will notify them that they have been outbid.
