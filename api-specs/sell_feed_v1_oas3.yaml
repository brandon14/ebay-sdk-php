Specifying both feed_type and schedule_id results in an error. Since schedules are based on feed types, you can specify a schedule (schedule_id) that returns the needed feed_type. If specifying the feed_type, limit which order tasks are returned by specifying filters such as the creation date range or period of time using look_back_days. If specifying a schedule_id, the schedule template (that the schedule_id is based on) determines which order tasks are returned (see schedule_id for additional information).

      description: 'This method associates the specified file with the specified task ID and uploads the input file. After the file has been uploaded, the processing of the file begins. Reports often take time to generate and it''s common for this method to return an HTTP status of 202, which indicates the report is being generated. Use the getTask with the task ID or getTasks to determine the status of a report. The status flow is QUEUED &gt; IN_PROCESS &gt; COMPLETED or COMPLETED_WITH_ERROR. When the status is COMPLETED or COMPLETED_WITH_ERROR, this indicates the file has been processed and the order report can be downloaded. If there are errors, they will be indicated in the report file. For details of how this method is used in the upload flow, see Working with Order Feeds in the Selling Integration Guide. Note: This method applies to all File Exchange feed types and LMS feed types except LMS_ORDER_REPORT and LMS_ACTIVE_INVENTORY_REPORT. See LMS API Feeds in the Selling Integration Guide and File Exchange FeedTypes in the File Exchange Migration Guide. Note: You must use a Content-Type header with its value set to &quot;multipart/form-data&quot;. See Samples for information.'
