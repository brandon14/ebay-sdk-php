          description: This field lets you filter by item aspects. The aspect name/value pairs and category, which is required, is used to limit the results to specific aspects of the item. For example, in a clothing category one aspect pair would be Color/Red. <br /><br />For example, the method below uses the category ID for Women's Clothing. This will return only items for a woman's red shirt.<br /><br /><code>/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=shirt&category_ids=15724&aspect_filter=categoryId:15724,Color:{Red}</code> <br /><br />To get a list of the aspect pairs and the category, which is returned in the <b>dominantCategoryId</b> field, set <b>fieldgroups</b> to <code>ASPECT_REFINEMENTS</code>.   <br /><br /> <code>/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=shirt&amp;fieldgroups=ASPECT_REFINEMENTS</code> <br /><br /><span class="tablenote"><b> Note:</b> The pipe symbol is used as a delimiter between aspect filter values.

      description: '  <p>This method is a bridge between the eBay legacy APIs, such as  <b> Shopping</b>, and <b> Finding</b> and the eBay Buy APIs. There are differences between how legacy APIs and RESTful APIs return the identifier of an "item" and what the item ID represents. This method lets you use the legacy item ids retrieve the details of a specific item, such as description, price, and other information the buyer needs to make a purchasing decision. It also returns the RESTful item ID, which you can use with all the Buy API  methods.</p>  <p>For more information about how to use legacy ids with the Buy APIs, see <a href="/api-docs/buy/static/api-browse.html#Legacy">Legacy API compatibility</a> in the Buying Integration guide.</p>  <p>This method returns the item details and requires you to pass in either the item ID of a non-variation item or the item ids of both the parent and child of an item group. An item group is an item that has various aspect differences, such as color, size, storage capacity, etc.</p> <p>When an item group is created, one of the item variations, such as the red shirt size L, is chosen as the "parent". All the other items in the group are the children, such as the blue shirt size L, red shirt size M, etc.</p>    <p>The <b> fieldgroups</b> URI parameter lets you control what is returned in the response. Setting <b> fieldgroups</b> to <code>PRODUCT</code>, adds additional fields to the default response that return information about the product of the item.
