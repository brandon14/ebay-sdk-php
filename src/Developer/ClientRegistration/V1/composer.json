This is required by the EU's Second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) which requires all regulated Account Servicing Payment Service Providers (ASPSPs) to provide secure APIs to access account and payment services on behalf of account holders.<br/><br/>A successful registration response returns a <b>HTTP 201 Created</b> status code with a JSON payload [RFC7519] that includes registration information.",
